# Sample API Responses

This directory contains sample API responses from Channex for testing and type generation.

To use these samples:

1. Save API responses from Channex here
2. Run the improve-types command:
   ```bash
   npm run command improve-types -- properties samples/properties.json
   ```

This will analyze the JSON structure and generate TypeScript interfaces.
